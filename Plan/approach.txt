Core Features
    Code Suggestions:
        Provide intelligent autocompletion and snippet generation for TypeScript/JavaScript.

    Error Detection & Fixes:
        Analyze code for common mistakes, highlight errors, and offer potential fixes.

    Test Generation:
        Automatically generate test cases for functions or modules.

    Documentation Generation:
        Create inline comments, function descriptions, and API documentation based on the code context.

2. AI API Selection
    DeepSeek-V2 API:
        Since GPT-3.5 Turbo isn’t free, we’ll leverage the free DeepSeek-V2 API (or similar free alternatives) for all AI-powered tasks.
3. Architecture Overview
    VS Code Extension Frontend:

    Built with TypeScript.
        Provides UI commands (via command palette and context menus) for each feature (e.g.,    “Suggest Code”, “Find Errors”, “Generate Tests”, “Document Code”).
    
    Backend Integration:
        The extension will call the DeepSeek-V2 API directly from the extension code (or through a lightweight Node.js proxy if needed for security).
        The API calls will include the current code context as input, and the responses (suggestions, error fixes, etc.) will be rendered in the extension.

    Data Flow:
    User invokes a command (e.g., “Generate Documentation”).
    The extension captures the relevant code snippet and context.
    It sends a prompt to the DeepSeek-V2 API.
    The API returns generated content, which is then inserted or shown to the user.
